# higherr
The aim is to be able to aid students in decision making for their most relevant colleges with the help of user generated content and reviews. The initial development plan is to get the front-end built to be able to conduct user testing and collect feedback on the concept, flows and use cases which will be used for further iterations of the product.  The target audience of the platform will be students and prospective from the age of 17 â€“ 30 years. It would be good if the look and feel is centered around the target audience and concept.  For this version of the prototype, we will be focusing only on an interface optimized for both Chrome on Desktop and Mobile. The prototype will be built based on the Material Design specs and using Angular Material for its implementation.

## BUILD PROJECT
